<h1>RichText</h1>

The `RichText` component is used for converting markdown to jsx. The main advantage of `RichText` is that it overrides

Additionally, it allows you to write the specific tags with expanded functionality, e.g. `<openSupportChatButton/>`

This component basically used in Strapi Dynamic Zones.
